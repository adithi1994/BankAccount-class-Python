# BankAccount-class-Python
Task: Create a BankAccount class with attributes account_number, holder_name, and balance. Include methods for: 

deposit(amount) to add money to the balance. 

withdraw(amount) to deduct money from the balance. 

Display account details using a display() method. 

Please note that the user should only be able to withdraw an amount if it is in the limit of the available balance. Also keep in mind to not to execute all the methods at once. Instead ask for users input and based on that input execute any method that the user asks for.
